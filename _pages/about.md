**Hey there!**

Since I was eleven years old, I have been sure I loved computing. I did not know how computers worked, 
but their ability to make our lives easier has always fascinated me. From the very beginning, I knew I 
wanted to know everything that I could about computers in order to understand them, and now I have the 
chance to do so.

I have co-founded my own company ([Kodular](https://www.kodular.io), owned by _Junnovate, LLC_) with 
other teenagers around the world. Currently, we have nearly 1.5M daily active users and we are partnered 
with companies like Unity and StartApp.  
But what is more important: lots of schools, high-schools and colleges are using our platform to teach 
programming.
